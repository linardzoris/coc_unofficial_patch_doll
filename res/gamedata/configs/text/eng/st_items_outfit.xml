		<text>Leather trench coat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_description">
		<text>A regular black leather trench coat. It has no special purpose other than to keep the wearer warm at night or protect them from a blind dog bite. Although the trench coat is not particularly comfortable, it is often used by bandits in the Zone, either because it allows them to hide in the dark, or simply due to its 'cool' appearance.</text>

		<text>Bandit mercenary suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_description">
		<text>The outfit of choice for the majority of mercenaries in the Zone, recently 'liberated' by bandits. This variation suffers from external damage, reducing the amount of protection across the board; however, whilst it is not only less costly, it is much easier to get a hold of.</text>

		<text>Bandit stalker suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_stalker_outfit_description">

	<string id="csky_heavy_assault_outfit_name">
		<text>CS-3b body armour</text>
	</string>
	<string id="csky_heavy_assault_outfit_description">
		<text>The CS-3b body armour is a suit originally designed by Clear Sky for combat during the faction wars, but has long since been re-purposed. The majority of its bulk comes from the materials made to shield the wearer against any bullets, and its protection against anomalies is likewise sturdy.

		<text>Clear Sky Sunrise suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="cs_stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>A Clear Sky-branded Sunrise bodysuit, most commonly found among members of the faction who had already possessed unmodified Sunrise bodysuits at the start of their membership. As with regular Sunrise suits, the Clear Sky Sunrise suit features little protection against bullets, but has proven to be popular due to its low cost and potential for modification.

		<text>Clear Sky scientific suit</text>
	</string>

		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defence Research Institutes, is a great alternative to home-made stalker suits. It has been adopted by Clear Sky and repainted in the faction's primary colours. While its built-in body armour can only stop light rounds, the anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none.

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is based on the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour and modified for used in the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection.

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced by Freedom specially for research in the Zone.

		<text>A stalker bodysuit worn by mercenaries in the Zone, painted in murky colours.

	<string id="army_outfit_description">

	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a programme in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst many factions, particularly the mercenaries, as while it may lack strong protection against anomalies, it makes up for this by providing moderate bullet protection.</text>
