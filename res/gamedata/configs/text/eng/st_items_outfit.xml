	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_name">
		<text>Leather trench coat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_description">
		<text>A regular black leather trench coat. It has no special purpose other than to keep the wearer warm at night or protect them from a blind dog bite. Although the trench coat is not particularly comfortable, it is often used by bandits in the Zone, either because it allows them to hide in the dark, or simply due to its 'cool' appearance.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_name">
		<text>Bandit mercenary suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_description">
		<text>The outfit of choice for the majority of mercenaries in the Zone, recently 'liberated' by bandits. This variation suffers from external damage, reducing the amount of protection across the board; however, whilst it is not only less costly, it is much easier to get a hold of.</text>

		<text>Armoured trench coat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trenchcoat_brown_outfit_description">

		<text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>

		<text>This modern version of the Duty bodysuit is better suited for stalkers who are used to or prefer lightweight suits. Unlike the PSZ series, this suit also provides good protection against anomalies.

	</string>

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
		<text>PSZ-9d body armour</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is based on the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour and modified for used in the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Ecologists -->
	<string id="ecolog_outfit_orn_name">
		<text>SSP-99 protection suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ecolog_outfit_orn_description">
		<text>The SSP-99 chemical protection suit is specially designed by the Ecologists for use in the Zone. It features an integrated air-filtering and air-conditioning system. It is also heat and electricity resistant, and provides good protection against radiation and chemically aggressive environments. It is not designed for combat, so it provides little bullet and splinter protection. Comes with two artefact containers.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="ecolog_outfit_grn_name">
		<text>SSP-99M protection suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ecolog_outfit_grn_description">

		<text>Guardian of Freedom</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armour comprises armour plating and ten Kevlar layers capable of stopping a pistol bullet, along with the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Freedom scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced by Freedom specially for research in the Zone. The closed system of breathing and special treatment materials provide excellent protection against harmful radiation and anomalous effects. However, the built-in body armour is not the best, and can break somewhat easily, so it is unsuitable for active hostilities. Fully upgradeable and boasting two built-in artefact containers.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Mercenaries -->
	<string id="merc_outfit_name">
		<text>Mercenary suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="merc_outfit_description">
		<text>Outfit of choice for the Mercenary faction. Its design is based on the suit used by the special forces of Western armies.

	</string>

	<string id="merc_heavy_outfit_name">
		<text>Mercenary heavy suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="merc_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>A stalker bodysuit worn by mercenaries in the Zone, painted in murky colours. The suit has a common presence amongst any mercenaries who have had experience in the Zone prior to becoming a part of the faction; nonetheless, its lack of resistance towards anything stronger than a pistol bullet makes it a seldom preferred alternative in comparison to other outfits. Comes with a built-in artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="merc_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Mercenary scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="merc_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>A suit used by mercenaries who often work in or near anomalous areas. It includes a protection system with a closed cycle, built-in suppression action anomalous fields. It provides good protection from bullet and shrapnel hit, but not enough for large-scale hostilities. Fully upgradeable and boasting two built-in artefact containers.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="merc_radiation_outfit_name">
		<text>Mercenary radiation suit</text>
	</string>

		<text>Berill-5M armoured suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="specops_outfit_description">
		<text>This item comprises military PS5 series body armour with beryllium coating modified for use in the Zone. Designed for assault operations in highly radioactive areas, it is ineffective in areas of high anomalous activity. The suit makes its way to stalkers through the military, who exchange it for loot. Does not come with an artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="military_outfit_name">
		<text>SKAT-9 'Bulat' military armoured suit</text>

	<string id="monolith_outfit_name">
		<text>Monolith suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="monolith_outfit_description">
		<text>Standard body armour worn by the Monolith faction. Whilst many variants exist to improve their scientific or combat abilities, this model is the most common, being based on the Sunrise suit used by ordinary stalkers. Comes with two artefact containers.</text>

	<string id="monolith_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Monolith scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="monolith_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>The Monolith scientific suit includes a flak vest of unknown origin and also features unique modifications for greater resistance to radiation at the cost of being more vulnerable to psi-fields.

		<text>Monolith radiation suit</text>

	<!-- Loners -->
	<string id="novice_outfit_name">
		<text>Leather jacket</text>
	</string>
	<string id="novice_outfit_description">
		<text>The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions, considering it is simply a leather anorak. Typically, it is also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. The leather offers little protection from gunfire or claws, and is absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_name">
		<text>Sunrise suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of twin-layered rubberised cloth with Plexiglas lining and built-in body armour. Despite the fact that the body armour is often strained by anything beyond even pistol bullets, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential. Comes with a built-in artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>SEVA suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defence Research Institutes, is a great alternative to home-made stalker suits. The anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none. Fully upgradeable and boasting two built-in artefact containers, this bodysuit is the equipment of choice for many experienced stalkers.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="radiation_outfit_name">
		<text>Radiation suit</text>

	<string id="st_helm_battle_descr">
		<text>An aluminium/titanium helmet with a cloth exterior that comes with pockets for additional steel armour pieces and an armoured face mask. The Sphere M12 is normally used as part of a combination that includes PSZ series Spetsnaz body armour. Quite popular in the Zone thanks to its respirator and built-in first generation night vision device, as well as providing a large amount of head protection. Comes with electronics slots.</text>

	<string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">
		<text>A desperately outdated steel army helmet without any additions. It provides no protection against anomalies or radiation, but can deflect bullets. The helmet has never been particularly popular in the Zone outside of brief armed conflicts between factions, although it sees a fair amount of use amongst members of Clear Sky, usually being fitted with a respirator for the faction's missions.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_helm_m40">
		<text>M40 field protective mask</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a programme in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst many factions, particularly the mercenaries, as while it may lack strong protection against anomalies, it makes up for this by providing moderate bullet protection.</text>

	<string id="st_helm_protective">
		<text>Screen helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_protective_descr">
		<text>A light helmet with an airtight visor intended for protection against anomalies. Judging by the design, the helmet is made by the same Defence Research Institutes as the SEVA suit. Its intended use may very well be in combination with military suits for operations in highly anomalous areas.</text>

	<string id="st_helm_respirator_descr">

		<text>GP-5 gas mask</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_respirator_gp5_descr">
		<text>The GP-5 was designed to protect civilians of the Soviet Union from radioactive fallout during the Cold War and was manufactured from 1962 to 1989. This mask is a helmet-type mask which was made in both white and black rubber. The lenses of these masks are held in place by crimped metal rims, crimped onto the rubber of the mask. The bottom of the mask is made of metal, and in it is the 40mm filter input, and the inhale and exhale valves.
